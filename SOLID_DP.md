# SOLID Design Principles and Applied Design Patterns

## Introduction

In the development of the Pizza Restaurant application, several design patterns have been implemented to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and adherence to SOLID principles. This document outlines the design patterns used and how they align with each of the SOLID principles.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## Applied Design Patterns

### 1. **Factory Pattern**

- **Description:** The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **SOLID Alignment:**
  - **OCP:** The Factory Pattern allows the system to be open for extension but closed for modification. New pizza types can be added without altering existing factory code.
  - **SRP:** The creation logic is encapsulated within the factory, ensuring that classes have a single responsibility.

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**

- **Description:** The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
- **SOLID Alignment:**
  - **OCP:** New pricing strategies can be added without modifying the existing codebase.
  - **ISP:** Clients can use only the strategies they need without being forced to depend on unnecessary methods.

### 3. **Observer Pattern**

- **Description:** The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **SOLID Alignment:**
  - **LSP:** Observers can be substituted with new ones without affecting the subject.
  - **DIP:** High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

### 4. **Decorator Pattern**

- **Description:** The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **SOLID Alignment:**
  - **OCP:** New functionalities can be added without altering existing object structures.
  - **SRP:** Responsibilities are divided among different decorator classes, each handling a specific enhancement.

## Conclusion

By implementing these design patterns, the Pizza Restaurant application adheres to the SOLID principles, resulting in a robust, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Each pattern not only solves specific design challenges but also ensures that the system remains flexible to future changes and extensions.
